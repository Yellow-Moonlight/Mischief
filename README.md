## Mischief

“Mischief” is a series of toy instruments created as part of research for the “sound-playground.” ‘Sound-Playground’ is the playground, that i am going to make one day, where the children’s play generates the sound.

For this project, i hacked four existing toys, and designed one instrument. 
The toy works as a sequencer—when blocks are placed on its panel, it starts playing, and the weight of the blocks determines the notes. 
The Hammer bank functions as both a sample player and a looper. 
The rocking horse(Schaukelpferd) adds a reverb effect, 
the RC car generates synthesizer sounds, and the airplane creates bass sounds.

At each folder, you can check the photo, sketch, code, and circuit.
